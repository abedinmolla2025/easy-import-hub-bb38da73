        "Different Islamic authorities use slightly different angles (called Fajr/Isha angles), producing small variations. Noor uses the ISNA method (Islamic Society of North America) by default: 15° for Fajr and 15° for Isha, which is widely accepted in South Asia and North America.",
        "Dhuhr is derived from solar noon, Asr from the Shafi'i shadow-length formula, and Maghrib from sunset. Times shift by a few minutes each day as the Earth orbits the sun.",

      q: "What is the ruling on missing a prayer?",

    {
      q: "Can I pray Isha late at night?",
